## Powerlifting Database
This is a website used to track personal record lifts between the squat, bench press, and dead lift (the three lifts of powerlifting).
There are five fields for submission, consisting of the name of the individual, their body weight, as well as the 3 weights of their successful lifts. 
There is one derived field, consisting of the total weight between the three lifts, which is computed by the server.

I used the CSS grid to help postion the location of my button and table on the website.

## Technical Achievements
- **Singe Page Application**: By have the submission button always reload the table, the website is always able to display an up to date lifting database.
- **Page Modification**: TODO

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
