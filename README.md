# Assignment 3 - Persistence: Two-tier Web Application with Database, Express server, and CSS template

- (10 points) Use of a [CSS framework or template](https://github.com/troxler/awesome-css-frameworks). This should do the bulk of your styling/CSS for you and be appropriate to your application.
  For example, don't use [NES.css](https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/) (which is awesome!) unless you're creating a game or some type of retro 80s site.

- (5 points) Instead of Glitch, host your site on a different service. Find a service that is reputable and has a free tier. Post your findings on Slack in the #assignment3 channel. DO NOT feel compelled to purchase a paid tier from any service, although if you already have one, you are welcome to use it. Make sure to describe this a bit in your README. What was better about using the service you chose as compared to Glitch? What (if anything) was worse?
- (5 points) Get 100% (not 98%, not 99%, but 100%) in all four lighthouse tests required for this assignment.

_Design/UX_

- (10 points) Make your site accessible using the [resources and hints available from the W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/), Implement/follow twelve tips from their [tips for writing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/writing/), [tips for designing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/designing/), and [tips for development](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/developing/). _Note that all twelve must require active work on your part_.
  For example, even though your page will most likely not have a captcha, you don't get this as one of your twelve tips to follow because you're effectively
  getting it "for free" without having to actively change anything about your site.
  Contact the course staff if you have any questions about what qualifies and doesn't qualify in this regard.
  List each tip that you followed and describe what you did to follow it in your site.
- (5 points) Describe how your site uses the CRAP principles in the Non-Designer's Design Book readings.
  Which element received the most emphasis (contrast) on each page?
  How did you use proximity to organize the visual information on your page?
  What design elements (colors, fonts, layouts, etc.) did you use repeatedly throughout your site?
  How did you use alignment to organize information and/or increase contrast for particular elements.
  Write a paragraph of at least 125 words _for each of four principles_ (four paragraphs, 500 words in total).

## Powerlifting Database V2

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- the goal of the application
- challenges you faced in realizing the application
- what authentication strategy you chose to use and why (choosing one because it seemed the easiest to implement is perfectly acceptable)
- what CSS framework you used and why
  - include any modifications to the CSS framework you made via custom CSS you authored
- the five Express middleware packages you used and a short (one sentence) summary of what each one does. If you use a custom function for _one_ (and one alone) middleware please
  add a little more detail about what it does.

## Technical Achievements

- **Github OAuth**: I used axios to facilitate sending HTTP requests in order to authenticate using GitHub. This was difficult because I had to look into documentation for unfamiliar packages, and had to debug and figure how to operate this process.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements

- **Accessibility**: I followed the following tips from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative...

- **CRAP Principles**: I followed the following tips from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative...
